Data-Easy
=========

Consistent set of utility functions for Maybe, Either, List and Monoids.

Easy to use set of utility funcions, implementing a Data.Maybe like interface
for other common types like Either, List, Bool, Tuple or even members of the 
Monoid type class.

Also features a set of conversion functions between all these types 
using sensible defaults.

Most of these functions are one liners, and this library started out as a
self-educational project, which nevertheless proved to to be useful on its
own right.
